# Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Lab Project: Linux System Hardening

## Executive Summary
This project documents a comprehensive Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) lab focused on securing a Linux system. Using **Lynis** as the primary audit tool, 44 findings were identified and addressed through mitigation efforts mapped to **NIST 800-171** controls and **CIS Benchmarks**.  

Key mitigations included strengthening password policies, configuring firewalls, securing the GRUB bootloader, disabling unused protocols (SCTP), and implementing patch management tools like apt-show-versions. Evidence of fixes is provided through configuration files, terminal outputs, and verification logs.

---

## Objectives
- Identify and analyze system vulnerabilities using **Lynis**.
- Map findings to **NIST 800-171** controls and **CIS Benchmarks**.
- Implement mitigation strategies for each finding to reduce risk.
- Document the process with evidence for audit readiness.

---

## Tools and Frameworks
- **Audit Tools**: Lynis, apt-listbugs, apt-show-versions
- **Frameworks**: NIST 800-171 (IA-5, AC-6, SC-7, SI-2), CIS Benchmarks

## Screenshots
### Environment - Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine Deployment

### Lynis Scan â€“ Initial Findings
![Initial Lynis Scan ](./Screenshots/Lynis_Security_scan.png)

- Above is the initial security scan that Lynis produced
- As we can see, there is a 60 hardness score, which is out of 100

![Lynis Warnings Section ](./Screenshots/Lynis_warnings.png)

- Above, we find that Lynis produces warnings
- Warnings are critical actions that need to be resolved

![Initial Lynis Scan ](./Screenshots/Lynis_suggestions.png)

- The most exciting part about this project is above
- Lynis produces suggestions in its reports to aid in system hardening
- What was most exciting for me was making decisions myself that I felt needed to be dealt with to make sure the system is hardened
- For this project, I am currently working through all 44 suggestions and deciding which actions need to be taken

## Security Controls Applied
- **IA-5 (Authenticator Management)**: Enforced strong password policies, PAM configuration, password complexity, and history settings.
- **AC-6 (Least Privilege)**: Disabled unused protocols (SCTP), secured GRUB, configured default umask for files and directories.
- **SC-7 (Boundary Protection)**: Configured UFW/iptables firewall rules, ensuring proper inbound and outbound traffic restrictions.
- **SI-2 (Flaw Remediation)**: Installed apt-listbugs and apt-show-versions for proactive patch management.

---

## Project Outcome
- Enhanced system security posture by addressing critical vulnerabilities.
- Demonstrated expertise in **GRC principles**, **Linux hardening**, and **NIST 800-171** compliance.
- Provided clear documentation and evidence suitable for audit purposes and portfolio showcase.
